# Code for: Täuber et al. (in prep.) - "Complementarity or Overlap: Refining our view on tree-tree interactions reveals their relation to leaf traits and crown structure"

This is the code for the paper [Täuber et al. (in prep.)]() To see it in action, please head over [here](https://ataeub.github.io/cci-coi-tree-interaction/) for a rendered version of the two Quarto notebooks in this repository. If you want to run the statistical analysis yourself, you can download the required dataset from [here](https://data.botanik.uni-halle.de/bef-china/datasets/717). You will need to paste the raw .csv into the `data/results/` directory and then run the `models.qmd`.

The structural analysis notebook does not contain any rendered code as it would look quite boring, since the fancy stuff happens behind the scenes. If you want to calculate COI and CCI for your own point clouds, please head [here](https://ataeub.github.io/coi/) to install the `coi` R-library.

If you want to fully replicate our results and run the structural analysis code on the original data, please contact me via my [Email](mailto:alexander.taeuber@idiv.de).

If you want to use this code please cite the paper, and: [![DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18443104.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18443104).
